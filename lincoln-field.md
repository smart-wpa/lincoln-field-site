Athletic Field for Lincoln High School
--------------------------------------

### Latest News

After extensive community input and further evaluation of Wallingford Playfield, we are proposing to serve Lincoln High School, Hamilton International Middle School, and the Wallingford community by installing a half-size field that stays approximately within the current field footprint. We will also be working with Seattle Parks and Recreation (SPR) to find an appropriate location to build a new full-size field that will meet the needs of Lincoln High School athletics.

*   This approach ensures the park’s character remains intact, balancing current community use with minor additional school-related use.
*   We are not planning lighting for this revised proposal.
*   This proposal is still under review by SPR and subject to their approval prior to moving forward.

#### Next Steps and Stakeholder Engagement

We appreciate the robust feedback from the community regarding where to locate a synthetic turf athletic field for Lincoln High School as well as for potential use by Hamilton International Middle School. 

Currently, we are discussing next steps with Seattle Parks and Recreation (SPR). All feedback received through comment cards, by email, and though our Let’s Talk portal has been shared with SPR, and they have attended both community meetings.

We will continue to update the website when we have additional information to share.

### About the Project

Lincoln High School is the only high school in the district without an athletic field. When Seattle voters approved the 2022 capital levy, the school-specific projects included a new practice field for Lincoln High School.

The new Lincoln High School Practice Field would provide an athletics practice “home field” for students at Lincoln High School. It would give Lincoln High School students a state-of-the-art, full -size turf field for soccer, football and other sports, restrooms, and storage for athletic equipment.

In addition, a practice running track would be upgraded at the nearby Lower Woodland #7 field to accommodate Lincoln’s robust track and field program.

**Location Search**

There is not room to add a field on the Lincoln site, so SPS has been looking for an alternative site where a field can be constructed.

**Funding**

This project is funded by the [Buildings, Technology, and Academics/Athletics Capital Levy](https://www.seattleschools.org/about/levy/2022-capital-levy/) (BTA V), which was approved by Seattle voters in 2022.

These funds cannot help the district close the budget gap. Funding from a capital levy must be used for the specified purposed. Capital levy funding cannot be transferred to the general fund, which is the account where operations and staffing are budgeted.

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Questions about the project

##### How will you ensure transparency in the decision-making process and community engagement?

Transparency is a key element of this project. We will provide clear documentation of community feedback. This will help SPS and SPR make informed decisions that reflect the needs of the entire community, not just specific interest groups. We will also ensure that any public meetings and engagements are approved by SPR leadership to maintain alignment with the overall process.

##### Why does Lincoln High School need an athletics practice field?

Lincoln High School is the only high school in the district without an athletic field, which limits opportunities for Lincoln’s students.

For many students, after-school sports such as soccer, football, and track are a big part of their high school experience. The lack of facilities requires Lincoln students to travel to distant fields, disproportionately affecting students without access to reliable transportation.

Without a field, Lincoln students are limited to physical education (PE) within the gymnasium or at Wallingford Playfield, which is largely unusable during the winter months due to rain, snow, and lack of lighting.

##### How will this project help students?

The new Lincoln High School Practice Field would provide an athletics practice “home field” for students, giving them a state-of-the-art, full-size turf field for soccer and football, restrooms, and storage for athletic equipment.

Developing the Lincoln High School Practice Field is not just about providing athletic facilities—it’s also about ensuring the safety and well-being of our students.

Many Lincoln students have to travel long distances for early morning and late evening practices. During the fall and winter months, this means students are leaving campuses in the dark, raising safety con

##### Where do Lincoln High School students practice now?

Lincoln High School varsity football and varsity soccer practice and play at Memorial Stadium, which is three miles away from campus. Students without access to reliable transportation face barriers to participating in these kinds of athletics.

Junior varsity teams and others use fields at Lower Woodland and sites around the area. Track athletes are currently bused to Ingraham High School, about five miles away from Lincoln.

##### Will this field meet the needs of all Lincoln students, or just a select group?

This field is intended to serve a wide range of students, including those participating in various sports like soccer, football, and other field-based activities.

We are committed to ensuring equitable access for all Lincoln and Hamilton students, in line with Title IX requirements.

Wherever it is located, the field will be available to the broader community, offering a resource for everyone in the neighborhood.

##### How will this project ensure equitable access for girls and other underrepresented athletes?

Equity is a priority in the planning of this project. The field will not be reserved solely for football or boys’ teams.

The field will be available for multiple sports, including girls’ teams and other athletic programs. The scheduling of the field will follow Seattle Public Schools’ commitment to Title IX, ensuring that all students, regardless of gender, have fair access to athletic resources.

##### Where does Lincoln High School currently hold PE classes outside of the gymnasium?

Lincoln High School currently uses Wallingford Playfield for physical education (PE) classes, which is largely unusable during the winter months due to rain, snow, and lack of lighting. Lincoln students share this field with nearby Hamilton International Middle School.

##### Is the project cost-effective, given the current financial constraints and potential school closures?

Funding included in voter-approved capital levies must be used for the designated capital improvements to schools and school facilities. The funds cannot be used for operating costs. 

The Lincoln High School Practice Field project is funded by the voter-approved Buildings, Technology, and Academics/Athletics V capital levy (BTA V). It is a forward-thinking investment in our students and community, helping ensure that Seattle remains a vibrant, inclusive, and sustainable place to live and learn.

If the field is placed at Wallingford Playfield, we will be investing in both the Lincoln and Hamilton school communities. The field will be a valuable student and community resource for years to come.

##### Why are these schools being prioritized for this project, and how will it impact other schools in the district?

Funding included in voter-approved capital levies must be used for the designated capital improvements to schools and school facilities. The funds cannot be used for operating costs. 

The Lincoln High School Practice Field project is funded by the voter-approved Buildings, Technology, and Academics/Athletics V capital levy (BTA V). It is a forward-thinking investment in our students and community, helping ensure that Seattle remains a vibrant, inclusive, and sustainable place to live and learn.

If the field is placed at Wallingford Playfield, we will be investing in both the Lincoln and Hamilton school communities. The field will be a valuable student and community resource for years to come.

##### Why can’t you continue to use the fields and facilities at Lower Woodland?

Lincoln will continue to use Lower Woodland facilities for Junior Varsity (JV) sports and sports other than soccer and football.

Because Lower Woodland is booked to capacity, it cannot accommodate additional needs.

##### Why can’t you install a field where the Lincoln Park lot is located?

The space available would not support a full-size or half-size athletic field.

SPS is required by City code to provide off-street parking.

##### Why can’t you use fields at other schools?

Logistically, we cannot transport students across multiple schools for PE classes during the school day.

Other schools use their fields for practice and games, and many are booked to capacity. Any additional use by Lincoln students would displace other programs.

The interlocal agreement with Seattle Parks & Recreation (SPR) allows them to schedule fields when not in use by the school, so this field will be available for the whole Wallingford community.

Transportation is a costly financial expense for athletics and Lincoln High School. A field near Lincoln will significantly cut costs.

Early morning and late evening commutes could be eliminated with a nearby practice “home field” for students and families.

##### Why can’t you continue to use Memorial Stadium?

Memorial Stadium will be unavailable from summer 2025 through summer 2027, as it undergoes a complete renovation, so varsity teams will be unable to use the field.

During this time, Lincoln students will need access to a field. More broadly, a “home field” for Lincoln High School brings many benefits to students at Lincoln and nearby Hamilton International Middle School.

Not only does a practice “home field” expand access and equity for students, but by limiting student commutes, we can reduce the number of buses, resulting in a smaller carbon footprint. Most importantly, students will not be required to travel long distances early mornings and late evenings.

##### Is this a permanent field? Will you move football and soccer back to Memorial Stadium once it’s complete?

The proposed field is intended to be a permanent practice space for Lincoln High School students — they will not return to the new Memorial Stadium for practice once it’s complete. 

##### What about sports other than football and soccer? Ultimate Frisbee? Tennis?

Other sports will be able to use this new field as scheduling allows. Since design has not yet been done, field markings can be considered for multiple sports. Students will also continue to have access to the Lower Woodland fields.

If the field is placed at Wallingford Playfield, there is no plan to impact the tennis courts, but the project team is open to evaluating potential options.

##### How will you address the “heat island” effect caused by turf, considering natural grass is better at reducing heat?

SPR standards call for light green turf and the lighter colors available for various markings. Cork infill also mitigates heat gain due to its lighter color.

This project will include efforts to align with climate initiatives, including increasing green spaces in other areas of the park.

##### Why are these schools being prioritized for this project, and how will it impact other schools in the district?

In 2022, voters passed a capital levy for school-specific projects, including a new practice field for Lincoln High School.

Lincoln High School is the largest high school in the district and the only high school with no field immediately adjacent to campus.

Similarly, Hamilton International Middle School is the only middle school in the district with no immediately adjacent field. If this project occurs at Wallingford Playfield, it will bring the Lincoln and Hamilton campus amenities inline with their counterparts around the district.

If this project does not move forward, other schools could be impacted by program displacement by Lincoln High School needing other fields around the district. 

##### Is it appropriate to prioritize a football field for a high school, especially when Lincoln is considered one of the more privileged schools in the city?

The field is intended to benefit all students, not just the football team, by providing a practice space for multiple sports.

SPS is committed to ensuring that all students, regardless of gender, have access to equitable athletic opportunities, in line with Title IX requirements.

The project is being designed with the needs of the entire student body in mind.

If located at Wallinford Playfield, the field will also serve nearby Hamilton International Middle School and the broader community.

#### Questions about site selection and design

##### What role does Seattle Parks & Recreation (SPR) play in this project?

SPR is a close partner to SPS in identifying potential locations and logistics of building this new practice field. Both are committed to selecting the best option for students and communities.

SPR and SPS will continue to collaborate during design and construction after the field location is determined.

##### Will people be able to use the field if it is placed at one of Seattle’s parks?

Yes. The Lincoln High School Practice Field can provide space for both the school and the broader community, ensuring the selected space remains a vibrant hub of activity.

Seattle Parks & Recreation (SPR) will maintain important elements and character of the space selected and will work to ensure all can continue to enjoy. The field will also become part of SPR’s inventory of fields available for scheduling.

##### Who will make the final decision on where to develop the field?

The final decision will be made jointly between Seattle Parks & Recreation (SPR) and SPS, guided and informed by community input. It’s important for our communities to be heard — that’s why we’re looking for input and feedback.

##### What kind of site evaluation have you done?

SPS has conducted a robust evaluation of potential sites for the new field. The search included nine total locations, each evaluated for student safety, accessibility, and sustainability.

After a thorough assessment, we are seeking community input on Wallingford Playfield for the new Lincoln High School Practice Field. We are also exploring alternatives — Meridian Playfield and Queen Anne Bowl.

**Update**: We are now exploring the other locations suggested by community members including the school parking lot, Gasworks Park, Lower Woodland, and Woodland Park.

##### Are you planning the track and field in the same location?

None of the evaluated locations can accommodate both a field and track. We are proposing developing the field at one of the Seattle Parks & Recreation (SPR) properties, and upgrading the existing track at Lower Woodland #7, also an SPR property.

##### Why isn’t the parking lot at Lincoln High School being converted back into a field?

When Lincoln High School was renovated, converting the parking lot into a field was considered, but ultimately, the current layout was chosen to meet the overall needs of the school’s infrastructure, including the parking required by City code.

However, we are revisiting this idea by exploring the feasibility of placing a field on top of the existing parking lot. Our design team is conducting a study to test this concept and determine if it is viable.

Update: The space available would not support a full-size or half-size athletic field.

##### Did you consider putting the field on the roof of Lincoln High School?

The roof of Lincoln High School is not designed to support a full-size field that can accommodate student needs.

In the initial planning of the Lincoln High School renovation, architects and engineers did explore combining a parking lot and garage with a rooftop field. Steep costs and significant risks made this option unfeasible.

##### Why can’t you build the field at Gasworks Park?

Gasworks Park was suggested at the September 19 community meeting. We are exploring this option.

The site is a designated landmark.

##### Has the potential closure of elementary schools been considered for alternative sites?

We are committed to exploring all options that balance the needs of students and the community. The Seattle School Board has not made any decisions on school closures at this time.

##### How will the installation of a new track at Lower Woodland affect the historic Metro League Cross Country (XC) course?

The Parks Department and Seattle Public Schools are aware of the long-standing use of Lower Woodland for Metro League Cross Country meets. While resurfacing the dirt track will improve conditions for track athletes and the public, care will be taken to ensure the cross country course remains safe and accessible. 

Planners will consult with Seattle Parks representatives to ensure the track design avoids obstacles, such as curbs or fences, that could interfere with the course.

##### Can the new track be designed to accommodate both track and cross country runners?

Yes, the plan is to surface the track in a way that ensures smooth transitions for cross country runners. Feedback from coaches and the running community will be essential in designing the track to minimize hazards and maintain access to the XC course.

The goal is to make the space functional for both track and cross country.

##### Will the field project include amenities beyond the practice field, such as lighting or seating?

The selected location will eventually include precise LED lighting, restrooms, and storage for equipment in addition to the synthetic turf field.

The field will include a minimal amount of seating.

##### What are the plans for the lighting and other features? How will you design the project to minimize light pollution?

A clear design process will be shared once a decision on location is made.

The field lighting will be hyper directional and designed not to spillover into surrounding homes and areas. SPS will use highly efficient LED lighting to minimize use of electricity.

##### What materials will be used for the turf, and how will potential environmental and health risks be addressed?

The turf will be made of synthetic materials, which are being carefully evaluated.The current SPS & SPR standard is 2.25” dual fiber (a mix of monofilament & slit-film polyethylene) with a sand/granular cork infill over a 1” supplemental resilient pad.

Disclosures about potential risks will be provided to families to ensure transparency and safety.

##### How will you address the “heat island” effect caused by turf, considering natural grass is better at reducing heat?

SPR standards call for light green turf and the lighter colors available for various markings. Cork infill also mitigates heat gain due to its lighter color.

This project will include efforts to align with climate initiatives, including increasing green spaces in other areas of the park.

##### Why not prioritize more sustainable and environmentally friendly options, given the concerns about turf?

We are fully aware of the environmental concerns surrounding turf, especially regarding heat islands and microplastics.

To mitigate these issues, the project will use cork infill to reduce heat gain, as well as other environmentally responsible design elements.

In addition, the project will align with Seattle’s sustainability goals by planting trees and increasing green spaces to offset any negative environmental impacts.

Our environmental review process will be transparent, and we welcome community feedback as we strive to balance athletic needs with environmental responsibility.

#### Questions about the Wallingford Playfield option

This questions and answers are related to the options presented at the September 19 meeting. Some of the answers include updates.

##### Why is Wallingford Playfield preferred over other locations?

Our preferred alternative is Wallingford Playfield after in-depth analysis showed it to be the best fit due to student needs, proximity to Lincoln High School, site layout, current use, and development needs. It will also benefit students at Hamilton International Middle School.

Alternative sites have not been eliminated from consideration, and we are continuing to evaluate options.

Update: We are now exploring the other locations suggested by community members including the school parking lot, Gasworks Park, Lower Woodland, and Woodland Park.

Update 2: SPS is now asking the community to respond to a suggestion to put a half-size synthetic turf field at Wallingford Playfield and to determine a location for a new full-size field at Woodland Park in partnership with the community and Seattle Parks.

##### How does this benefit community members who do not have students attending Lincoln High School or Hamilton International Middle School?

*   The entire community will be able to use this state-of-the-art field. The field will eventually include precise LED lighting to allow later use of the playfield.
*   Other park amenities will also be maintained and potentially upgraded. By adding lighting, the community can safely use this space well into the evening.

Update: A half-size synthetic turf field would not have lights and SPS would be unlikely to upgrade any other park areas. The new field could be used by the community.

##### If you put this field at Wallingford Playfield, what other improvements will be made?

The field would include the addition of precise LED lighting, making the playfield safer for everybody, especially in the fall and winter months. We welcome additional feedback on making this space the best resource it can be. 

We are actively exploring all options at the considered locations to make this space the best resource for all — our students and communities. 

Update: If a half-size synthetic field is installed at Wallingford Playfield, there will not be lights. It is unlikely that other improvements would be made by SPS.

##### How will construction of the practice field impact the Wallingford community?

If Wallingford Playfield is chosen for the project, it will be unavailable for approximately 3–4 months during the late spring and summer of 2025.

##### How will you minimize disruption during construction, and how will those living nearby be affected?

Our goal is to take all measures to minimize the impact to the neighbors and the surrounding community.

The contractors will maintain working hours that align with the City of Seattle’s Noise Ordinance. During construction, notices will be sent to neighbors when work falls outside of those times.

##### If Wallingford is selected, how will people who currently use the playfield be accommodated during construction?

Current playfield users will be rescheduled to other parks wherever possible during construction.

##### Will significant trees be removed if you put this field at Wallingford Playfield?

We understand the importance of maintaining and preserving significant trees at Wallingford Playfield. The Design Team will minimize significant tree removal wherever possible and will replace every tree removed with three additional trees.

##### If you do the project at Wallingford Playfield, how will you address traffic and parking concerns?

A thorough parking analysis and traffic study will be completed, and any required improvements will be made.

The parking lot at Lincoln High School will be available for use during non-school hours.

##### If you put this field at Wallingford Playfield, will there be a defined accessible route?

The Design Team will ensure that all code requirements are met. This includes accessibility under the American’s with Disabilities Act (ADA).

##### Would community access be limited once the new field is complete?

Once the project is completed, as a public park, the Wallingford Playfield will always be open for community access and current elements will be retained. 

Scheduling of the playfield outside of school use hours will go through the Seattle Parks & Recreation (SPR) scheduling process.

##### Where will we walk and play with our dogs if you renovate Wallingford Playfield for the practice field?

We are seeking input for the best way to provide space for dog walking.

Wallingford Playfield does not currently include an off-leash area, so this project would not remove existing dog park space.

##### How does this project align with Seattle’s sustainability goals, and what will be done to mitigate any negative environmental impacts?

If the Lincoln High School Practice Field is located at Wallingford Playfield, it will cut down student travel and reduce our carbon footprint.

By placing the field within walking distance of both Lincoln High School and Hamilton International Middle School, we can drastically reduce the need for buses, cutting down on pollution and environmental impact.

The Wallingford Playfield’s proximity to schools and homes make this location better for families looking to cut down on travel and fuel use.

The Wallingford Playfield location would provide a vital resource for our students while reducing our carbon footprint. 

##### Will the recently installed children’s playground remain at the park?

Yes. The playground area will remain either in its current location, or will be moved to a different location within the park.

Update: The playground and other park features would remain as they are if a half-size field were to be installed.

##### Will the Parks Department or SPS consider adding parking restrictions, like 4-hour limits, on nearby streets if a turf athletic field is installed at Wallingford Park?

The Parks Department and SPS understand the potential impact on parking in the neighborhood if the field is installed.

Any time the field is used for non-school activities, the Lincoln High School parking will be available.  
  
In addition, a parking study will be conducted to evaluate current usage and determine the best approach to managing parking. 

##### Will other features of the park, such as the playground, wading pool, picnic areas, tennis courts, and green spaces be removed if a turf field is installed at Wallingford Park?

No, the installation of a turf athletic field will not remove these features. The playground, wading pool, picnic areas, and tennis courts are important elements of Wallingford Playfield and would remain.

To fit the field, there is potential for some of the park’s features to be moved. The goal is to preserve the park’s multi-generational and multi-use nature, ensuring that it continues to serve all members of the community while providing additional athletic facilities.

##### How will the park maintain its role as a multigenerational and multi-use space if a large football field is added?

The project is being designed to ensure that the park continues to serve a diverse range of users. The field will be integrated into the existing layout without compromising access to other amenities.

The Parks Department and SPS are committed to balancing the needs of both the community and the students, ensuring that the park remains a vibrant space for all.

##### Can you install a grass field at Wallingford Playfield, or must it be turf?

In our evaluation, we heard from multiple users that the current grass field is not adequate for their needs, primarily in the fall and winter months, where the field is essentially unusable due to weather-worn conditions. 

Turf fields require less maintenance and offer more consistent playing conditions, especially in Seattle’s rainy climate, which can render grass fields unusable for extended periods.

##### How will the new turf field impact the park’s current users, especially families and local daycares?

The project team is dedicated to maintaining Wallingford Playfield as a multi-use space that serves all community members.

We are committed to preserving the existing amenities, such as the playground, wading pool, picnic areas, and tennis courts.

Any potential relocations of these features will be done with community input, ensuring continued access for families and local daycares.

The field itself will be available for both organized sports and casual community use during non-school hours.

##### What about people who use the park for activities that are not organized sports?

The Wallingford Playfield will continue to support a wide range of activities beyond organized sports.

The addition of a practice field is meant to complement, not replace, the current spaces that are used by the community for picnics, walking, playing with dogs, and other casual recreation.

Our goal is to ensure that the park remains a vibrant, multi-generational space where people of all ages can enjoy the outdoors.

##### What efforts are being made to preserve trees and shaded areas at the park?

Preserving the natural landscape, including trees and shaded areas, is a priority for this project.

If Wallingford Playfield is selected, we are committed to retaining significant trees and enhancing shaded areas, particularly around the playground and playfield.

We will also adhere to a 3:1 tree replacement ratio for any trees that need to be removed, ensuring that the park remains a green and welcoming space.

##### Will the project comply with HUD restrictions on Wallingford Playfield?

We are aware of the HUD restrictions governing the use of Wallingford Playfield, including the requirement that the land be used for recreational purposes. 

If Wallingford Playfield is selected, the project team will coordinate with HUD to ensure that any new features, such as restrooms, lighting, or storage facilities, comply with these guidelines.

##### How will the long-term maintenance of the new field and facilities be managed?

If the project moves forward at Wallingford Playfield, SPS and Seattle Parks & Recreation (SPR) will work together to determine responsibility for the long-term maintenance of the field, including restrooms and storage facilities.

This will include a clear plan for covering the costs of utilities, maintenance, and ongoing care for the space to ensure it remains a community asset for years to come.

##### What are the environmental impacts of converting a playfield to synthetic turf?

An environmental analysis will be completed prior to any work under the State Environmental Protection Act (SEPA). Findings and final determination will be posted and available to the public.

##### Why wasn’t acquisition of additional land considered as an option instead of Wallingford Playfield?

While acquisition of new land was not considered for this project, we understand the importance of addressing gaps in park access. 

Wallingford Playfield serves a large residential community, and we are committed to maintaining the park’s accessibility. 

Should this project move forward, SPS and SPR will explore ways to supplement park access in the area, particularly for those affected by any changes to Wallingford Playfield.
