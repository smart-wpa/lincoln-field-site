Track and Athletic Field for Lincoln High School
------------------------------------------------

**Updated August 2025**

### **About the Projects**

Lincoln High School is the only high school in the district without an athletic field or track. Funding to add these facilities were included in the voter-approved Buildings, Technology, and Athletics/Academics Capital Levy (BTA V) in 2022.

There is not room to add a track or athletic field on the Lincoln site, so SPS has been looking for alternative locations.

#### **Project 1: Track Upgrades at Woodland Park**

SPS and Seattle Parks & Recreation (SPR) have agreed to move forward with the track upgrades at Lower Woodland Field #7, which is owned by SPR. These improvements will support Lincoln’s robust track and field program. Our goal is to make the space functional for both track and cross country. Design work will begin this fall.

**Upcoming** **Community Information Meeting**

Join SPS and Seattle Parks and Recreation for an information session about the new track.

*   Saturday, Sept. 20, 11 a.m.
*   Lower Woodland Field #7, near the bleachers
*   Comments or questions? Use [Let’s Talk.](https://www.k12insight.com/Lets-Talk/dialogue.aspx?k=PR2F68N4B9LT@WF7G2YLT@MDLT@DY6FXZXLT@LDLT@NDLT)

#### **Project 2: Full-Size Athletic Field**

SPS and SPR are exploring locations at Woodland Park as a location for a new full-size athletic field. The field would be used for soccer, football, and other field sports. The project also includes restrooms and storage for athletic equipment.

By adding a new athletic field somewhere in Woodland Park, we will provide a “home field” for Lincoln student athletes and for physical education (PE) classes.

This field would be added to the interlocal agreement between SPS and SPR. This agreement provides SPS students with athletic facilities and allows those facilities to be used by the larger community outside of scheduled school use.

**Community Meeting**: **Save the Date**

Join SPS and Seattle Parks and Recreation for a community meeting to discuss potential locations at Woodland Park for the new full-size athletic field.

*   Wednesday, Oct. 15, 5:30 p.m.
*   Location to be announced
*   [Share your questions or feedback ahead of the meeting using Let’s Talk](https://www.k12insight.com/Lets-Talk/dialogue.aspx?k=PR2F68N4B9LT@WF7G2YLT@MDLT@DY6FXZXLT@LDLT@NDLT)

**Field** **Location**

Two locations have been identified as possible places to build the new field, Lower Woodland Field #2 and a parking lot at N. 50th St. and Aurora Ave. N. We will discuss these options at the community meeting.

These images show concepts to test fit of the field, not project designs. It’s important to consider how a field might fit on a space before exploring further.

**Option A: Lower Woodland Field #2**

### Previous Conversations

In 2024, SPS explored options for locating the athletic field at Wallingford Playfield. After engaging with the community, SPS and SPR decided to pause planning for any changes to Wallingford Playfield and instead focus on locating the field at Woodland Park. [The information on those discussion is available for review.](https://www.seattleschools.org/departments/capital-projects-and-planning/school-construction/projects/lincoln-field/lincoln-athletic-field-2024/)

Wallingford Playfield is not under consideration for the Lincoln High School full-size athletic field.

### **Funding**

This project is funded by the [Buildings, Technology, and Academics/Athletics Capital Levy](https://www.seattleschools.org/about/levy/2022-capital-levy/) (BTA V), which was approved by Seattle voters in 2022.

These funds cannot help the district close the budget gap. Funding from a capital levy must be used for the specified purposed. Capital levy project funding cannot be transferred to the general fund, which is the account where operations and staffing are budgeted.
