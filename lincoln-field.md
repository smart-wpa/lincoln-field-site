#### **Project 2, Option A revised to preserve BMX jumps**

The concept drawings for Project 2 option A have been update to avoid impacts to the bicycle jumps. [See Project 2.](https://www.seattleschools.org/departments/capital-projects-and-planning/school-construction/projects/lincoln-field/#gbe616709c9d2) (posted Sept. 3)

### About the Projects

Lincoln High School is the only high school in the district without an athletic field or track. Funding to add these facilities were included in the voter-approved Buildings, Technology, and Athletics/Academics Capital Levy (BTA V) in 2022.

There is not room to add a track or athletic field on the Lincoln site, so SPS has been looking for alternative locations.

### Project 2: Full-Size Athletic Field

SPS and SPR are exploring locations at Woodland Park as a location for a new full-size athletic field. The field would be used for soccer, football, and other field sports. The project also includes restrooms and storage for athletic equipment.

By adding a new athletic field somewhere in Woodland Park, we will provide a “home field” for Lincoln student athletes and for physical education (PE) classes.

This field would be added to the interlocal agreement between SPS and SPR. This agreement provides SPS students with athletic facilities and allows those facilities to be used by the larger community outside of scheduled school use.

#### In-Person **Community Meeting**: **New date, location set**

Join SPS and Seattle Parks and Recreation for a community meeting to discuss potential locations at Woodland Park for the new full-size athletic field.

*   **New Date: Thursday, Nov. 6, 2025**
*   **New Time: 6:30 p.m.**
*   **Location: Lincoln High School gymnasium**

#### **Field** Location

Two locations have been identified as possible places to build the new field, Lower Woodland Field #2 and a parking lot at N. 50th St. and Aurora Ave. N. We will discuss these options at the community meeting.

These images show concepts to test fit of the field, not project designs. It’s important to consider how a field might fit on a space before exploring further.

**New Information:** Our updated test fit layout ensures that the field in option A will no longer impact the BMX bicycle jump area. Please see below.

Thank you to the many community members who provided insight into the importance of maintaining these jumps.

**Updated** **Option A: Lower Woodland Field #2**

#### Frequently Asked Questions on the Full-Size Athletic Field

##### Why does Lincoln High School need an athletics practice field?

Lincoln High School is the only high school in the district without an athletic field or track, which limits opportunities for Lincoln’s students. For many students, after-school sports such as soccer, football, and track are a big part of their high school experience. The lack of facilities requires Lincoln students to travel to distant fields, disproportionately affecting students without access to reliable transportation.

##### How will this project help students?

The new athletic field would provide athletics “home field” for student athletics practice, giving them a state-of-the-art, full-size turf field for soccer, football and other field sports as well as restrooms, and storage for athletic equipment. A location closer to Lincoln reduces transportation and allows more flexibility for student schedules.

##### What role does Seattle Parks and Recreation (SPR) play in this project?

SPR is a close partner to SPS in identifying potential locations and logistics for building the track and the full-size athletic field. Collaboration will continue during design and construction.

##### Who will own and operate the athletic field?

Seattle Parks & Recreation will own any facilities built at Woodland Park. The athletic field will be added to the interlocal agreement between SPS and Seattle Parks & Recreation. This agreement provides SPS students with athletic facilities and allows those facilities to be used by the larger community outside of set school use.

##### Who will make the final decision on where to develop the athletic field?

The final decision will be made jointly between Seattle Parks & Recreation (SPR) and SPS, guided and informed by community input. It’s important for our communities to be heard — that’s why we’re looking for input and feedback.

##### Where does Lincoln High School practice now?

Currently, JV and varsity football are practicing at Ingraham. In the spring, boys’ soccer will also practice at Ingraham. Because Ingraham’s teams have priority, they are scheduling practice around use by Ingraham teams. Other teams, such as baseball, girls’ soccer, softball, and flag football, use fields at Lower Woodland and sites around the area for both practice and games.

##### Where will varsity games be played?

While Memorial Stadium is being replaced, Lincoln varsity home games are being played at the Northwest Athletic Center (located at Ingraham High School). Once Memorial Stadium re-opens, it will again be the home field for Lincoln varsity games.

##### Why can’t you continue to use the existing fields and facilities at Lower Woodland?

Lincoln will continue to use Lower Woodland facilities for sports such as baseball, girls’ soccer, softball, and flag football Because Lower Woodland is booked to capacity, it cannot accommodate additional needs.

##### Why can’t you use fields at other schools?

Other schools use their fields for practice and games, and many are booked to capacity. Any additional use by Lincoln students would displace other programs

##### Will this project displace existing community uses, such as the BMX jumps or skate park?

Our updated test fit layout ensures that the field will no longer impact the BMX bicycle jump area. Thank you to the many community members who provided insight into the importance of maintaining these jumps. The skate park will also remain in place.

##### Will construction of the athletic field close trails or limit park use?

If a site is selected, temporary construction impacts are expected but will be carefully managed. Some trails may have short-term closures, but detours and signage will maintain access whenever possible. SPS and SPR will communicate clearly about timelines, closures, and alternative options for recreation during construction.

##### Will the community be able to use the new full-size athletic field if it is located within Woodland Park?

Yes. The full-size athletic field will provide space for both the school and the broader community. The new field will become part of the SPR inventory of fields that is part of the interlocal agreement between SPS and SPR.

##### Can you put the new athletic field at the same location as the new track?

Locating the track and athletic field at Woodland Park will keep both facilities within the same park but not adjacent.

While we are studying locations at Woodland Park to potentially site the athletic field, we do not anticipate that there will be space for both a track and field.

We are planning upgrades to the track at Lower Woodland #7, but that field is not large enough to also include the new athletic field. In addition, upgrading the existing field would displace any athletic activities that currently take place on the field.

##### Why can’t Lincoln High School’s own parking lot be converted into an athletic field?

Lincoln’s campus footprint and existing parking lot size cannot accommodate a regulation full-size athletic field. While the parking lot site has been reviewed, it does not provide enough space to safely fit a field that meets state athletic standards. [You can see a test fit as part of the presentation](https://www.seattleschools.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Lincoln-Field-Mtg-2-Presentation.pdf) made at the November 20, 2024, community meeting – slide #6.

##### Why do you need to add another field? It seems like the two soccer fields that are at Lower Woodland are empty a lot.

During the 3-month fall season and the 3-month spring season, both fields are booked to 100% capacity for use by youth and adult teams and by Lincoln teams.

##### Why is Option B (parking lot site) being considered, even though some say it’s too far from Lincoln or from other athletic facilities?

Option B is under consideration because it transforms an underused gravel parking lot into an active recreational space. While it is slightly farther from Lincoln than Option A, it remains within walking distance and could offer better access to restrooms, visibility, and traffic management opportunities. The siting study is designed to weigh these trade-offs alongside community feedback.

##### Could one of the existing soccer fields be converted into a dual-use football/soccer field instead of building a new one?

Seattle Parks & Recreation (SPR) currently manages Lower Woodland’s soccer fields as heavily scheduled, high-demand community assets. While the idea of a convertible soccer/football field has been raised, this option would displace existing youth and adult soccer leagues that rely on these fields. SPS and SPR determined that siting a new field elsewhere in Woodland Park is the best way to meet Lincoln’s needs without reducing overall community access to soccer.

##### Does this mean that you have given up on putting a synthetic field at Wallingford Playfield?

Seattle Public Schools (SPS) has paused planning for changes at Wallingford Playfield to allow more time to explore options and gather broader input. While recognizing the project’s potential value for students and the community, SPS is taking this time to assess next steps thoughtfully. A future addition of a half-size field remains possible, provided funding is identified, to continue supporting play space for the community, the high school, and the middle school.

##### Are you looking for other options for locating the full-size athletic field?

We have explored 15 locations in the past 2.5 years, including some suggested by community members. [You can see the list as part of the presentation](https://www.seattleschools.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Lincoln-Field-Mtg-2-Presentation.pdf) made at the November 20, 2024, community meeting – slide #5.

##### What materials will be used for the turf, and how will potential environmental and health risks be addressed?

The turf will be made of synthetic materials, which are being carefully evaluated.

The current SPS and SPR standard is 2.25” dual fiber (a mix of monofilament and slit-film polyethylene) with a sand/granular cork infill over a 1” supplemental resilient pad. Disclosures about potential risks will be provided to families to ensure transparency and safety.

##### Can you use natural grass instead of synthetic turf?

We are aware of the environmental concerns surrounding turf, especially regarding heat islands and microplastics. To mitigate these issues, the project will use cork infill to reduce heat gain, as well as other environmentally responsible design elements. Our environmental review process will be transparent, and we welcome community feedback as we strive to balance athletic needs with environmental responsibility.

##### Will the field project include amenities beyond the practice field, such as lighting or seating?

The selected location will eventually include precise LED lighting and storage for equipment in addition to the synthetic turf field.

For Option A, the existing lighting would be redesigned to fit the new footprint. For Option B, lighting would be added. Seating will be provided at a level similar to that which is being installed at other high school athletic fields.

##### What about parking? Some neighbors say there isn’t enough, others say there’s already more than needed.

Parking will be part of the siting and design study. SPS and SPR recognize the concerns about both insufficient and excess parking near Woodland Park facilities. The goal is to balance student, spectator, and community access while encouraging safe walking, biking, and transit use. Input from neighbors and park users will inform decisions on parking layout, size, and access.

##### What is being done about traffic and safety in the Woodland Park Triangle (99, 50th St, Green Lake Way)?

Traffic and safety are important considerations. SPS will coordinate with SPR and the City of Seattle to address existing congestion and event-related traffic in the Woodland Park Triangle. This includes evaluating parking management, transit access, and pedestrian/bike safety. Community input will help shape strategies to reduce negative impacts and improve access for all.

### Previous Conversations

In 2024, SPS explored options for locating the athletic field at Wallingford Playfield. After engaging with the community, SPS and SPR decided to pause planning for any changes to Wallingford Playfield and instead focus on locating the field at Woodland Park. [The information on those discussion is available for review.](https://www.seattleschools.org/departments/capital-projects-and-planning/school-construction/projects/lincoln-field/lincoln-athletic-field-2024/)

Wallingford Playfield is not under consideration for the Lincoln High School full-size athletic field.

### Project 1: Track Upgrades at Woodland Park

SPS and Seattle Parks & Recreation (SPR) have agreed to move forward with the track upgrades at Lower Woodland Field #7, which is owned by SPR. These improvements will support Lincoln’s robust track and field program. Our goal is to make the space functional for both track and cross country. Design work will begin this fall.

#### **Community Information Meeting**

On Saturday, Sept. 20, community members joined us to learn more about this project.

[![outdoor meeting with one person standing with presentation board on easel and a group of people facing them in chairs](//www.seattleschools.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/meeting-20Sept2025jpg.jpg)](//www.seattleschools.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/meeting-20Sept2025jpg.jpg)

**What we heard**

Those in attendance specifically referenced a need for:

*   A fence all the way across behind the goals to keep lacrosse balls from the parking lots (they go at a high rate of speed)
*   Low fence to keep soccer balls from rolling onto track
*   Separating the walking path from the track (and keeping it useable during construction)
*   Need a pole vault area

Concerns were raised about drainage and the high water table, and about scheduling.

**Concept Image**

This image shows how the new track and related facilities could be located. It is not a final design.

#### Frequently Asked Questions About the Track

##### Why does Lincoln High School need a track?

Lincoln High School is the only high school in the district without track (or an athletic field), which limits opportunities for Lincoln’s students. For many students, after-school sports such as track, soccer, and football are a big part of their high school experience. The lack of facilities requires Lincoln students to travel to distant fields, disproportionately affecting students without access to reliable transportation.

##### Where do Lincoln track and field student athletes practice now?

Lincoln athletes currently use track and field event facilities Ingraham High School, about five miles from Lincoln High School. Ingraham has priority in scheduling, so Lincoln practices are scheduled later in the day or early in the morning.

##### How will this project help students?

The Lower Woodland Field #7 track upgrades will provide a “home field” for Lincoln’s extensive track program. This will allow track practice to take place after school instead of needing to adjust schedules to fit in around use of another school’s use of their track facility. It also reduces the need to take buses to Ingraham for practice.

##### What role does Seattle Parks and Recreation (SPR) play in this project?

SPR is a close partner to SPS in identifying potential locations and logistics for building the track and the full-size athletic field. Collaboration will continue during design and construction.

##### Who will own and operate the track?

Seattle Parks & Recreation will own any facilities built at Woodland Park. The track will be added to the interlocal agreement between SPS and Seattle Parks & Recreation. This agreement provides SPS students with athletic facilities and allows those facilities to be used by the larger community outside of set school use.

##### Will the community still be able to use the track at Lower Woodland Field #7?

Yes. The upgraded track can provide space for both the school and for the broader community. Seattle Parks & Recreation (SPR) field inside the track will remain part of the SPR inventory of fields that is part of the interlocal agreement between SPS and SPR. The track will be added to the interlocal agreement.

##### How will installation of the new track at Lower Woodland Field #7 affect the historic Metro League Cross Country (XC) course?

SPS and Seattle Parks & Recreation (SPR) are aware of the long-standing use of Lower Woodland for Metro League Cross Country meets. While resurfacing the dirt track will improve conditions for track athletes and the public, care will be taken to ensure the XC course remains safe and accessible. Planners will consult with SPR representatives to ensure the track design avoids obstacles, such as curbs or fences that could interfere with XC.

##### Can the new track be designed to accommodate both track and cross country (XC) runners?

Yes. The plan is to surface the track in a way that ensures smooth transitions for cross country runners. Feedback from coaches and the running community will shape the final design to minimize hazards and maintain access to the XC course. The goal is to make the space functional for both track and cross country.

##### Will the track project include amenities beyond the running track, such as lighting, seating, or space for field events practice?

Lower Woodland Field #7 already has lights and minimal bleachers. The lights will remain, and the bleachers will be replaced. The initial fit test designs include space for field event practice including shot put, long jump, discus, and other field events. A storage building will be added to store track and field events equipment.

##### How will you ensure transparency in the decision-making process and community engagement?

Transparency is a cornerstone of this project. We will share information openly, hold public meetings and information sessions, and provide updates as plans evolve. Community feedback will be documented and used to guide decisions at every stage of the process.

##### Are these projects cost-effective, given the district’s current financial constraints?

The Lincoln High School Athletic Field and Track projects are two parts of a project approved as part of the 2022 Buildings, Technology, and Academics/Athletics V Capital Levy. Funding included in voter-approved capital levies must be used for the designated capital improvements to schools and school facilities. The funds cannot be used for operating costs.

##### Can you put the new athletic field at the same location?

Locating the track and athletic field at Woodland Park will keep both facilities within the same park but not adjacent.

While we are studying locations at Woodland Park to potentially site the athletic field, we do not anticipate that there will be space for both a track and field. We are planning upgrades to the track at Lower Woodland #7, but that field is not large enough to also include the new athletic field. In addition, upgrading the existing field would displace any athletic activities that currently take place on the field.

### Funding

This project is funded by the [Buildings, Technology, and Academics/Athletics Capital Levy](https://www.seattleschools.org/about/levy/2022-capital-levy/) (BTA V), which was approved by Seattle voters in 2022.

These funds cannot help the district close the budget gap. Funding from a capital levy must be used for the specified purposed. Capital levy project funding cannot be transferred to the general fund, which is the account where operations and staffing are budgeted.
